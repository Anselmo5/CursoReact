# Mini-Blog:

Start: Npm run dev

I would like to share my new project, it is a mini-blog that allows users to share their posts with the blog community.

The project was created using JavaScript and React on the Front and Firebase on the Back.

I did this project with the intention of creating something different from what we have usually seen, integrating the back and front into the project.

The project includes user validation, user login, user creation, all connected to Firebase, and also includes adding, deleting and editing posts.
